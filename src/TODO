0) One should not get erorr when Eorb_imp.dat is missing.
0) szero should check $U$, $n0$ and $J$ and produce best guess for DC. It does not make sence that DC is by default set to zero, and if one does not specify it, takes infinite amount of time to converged.
0) During installation check for /usr/bin/time executable. If it does not exists, use someting alternative.
1) Break up the LDA and DMFT loops such that both programs run concurently and simultaneously.
2) The code does support ferromagnetic calculation. Just switch on Ferro in params.dat
3) Implement skip list inside ctqmc to speed up ctqmc
4) forces in the presence of SO not yet implemented.

5) In dmft1 we should use Binomial theorem to speed up calculation:
   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_inverse_theorem
   Also make sure that impurity times are saved in ':log'. They seem to be absent in current version!

6) In dmft2 we should also use Binomial theorem, as well as efficient eigenvalue solvers for "Hermitian+low-rank matrices".
